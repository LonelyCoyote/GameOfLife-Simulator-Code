# GameOfLife-Simulator-Code
This is a C# application created using Visual Studio 2017 Windows Forms Application.  It simulates Conways Game of Life on an infinite world.

I have not yet created an installer app for this executable.  So you will have to download the project and build it using Visual Studio 2017.

You may download the latest release (if you do not want to build it or don't have VS2017) from github at:
https://github.com/LonelyCoyote/GameOfLife-Simulator-Code/releases/tag/V1

If you have any problems or issues, please contact me :)
